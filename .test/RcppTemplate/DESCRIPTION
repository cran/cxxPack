Description: The Rcpp class library provides an object mapping between
        C++ classes and R classes including vectors, matrices, factors,
        dates, data frames, time series, and functions. This permits R
        to call C++ functions, and C++ to call R functions, with
        parameters and return values of any of these types. This
        package illustrates how to use the Rcpp library and in addition
        serves as a template that can be used to design new packages.
        The Rcpp library includes a foundation for a financial date
        library.
