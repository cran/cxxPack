Description: The Rcpp class library enables C++ to speak the language
        of R. The library maps the most commonly used R data structures
        to C++ classes. This includes vectors, matrices, factors,
        dates, data frames, time series, and functions. R can call C++
        functions, and C++ objects can call R functions, and the
        parameters and return values can be of any of the types just
        mentioned. This package serves two roles: 1. it serves as a
        demo package for Rcpp, and 2. it serves as a template for the
        creation of new packages that use the Rcpp library (and also
        for packages that do not). An important goal of the library is
        to support the creation of high-performance packages that do
        heavy computations on large data sets where a hybrid R/C++
        strategy is the best fit. See the document RcppDoc.pdf for more
        information. The R package Rcpp is a forked version of a
        previous version of this software and is not discussed here.
