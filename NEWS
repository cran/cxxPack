cxxPack Version 7.0.3 Released on 6/10/2010

Highlights:

o Builds on Rcpp package/library with a focus on reproducible
  research and C++ model classes (supplementing Rcpp's proxy classes).
  Derived from RcppTemplate 6.1.

o Instead of echoing vignette compile and link stats this information
  is now written to a log file (inst/doc/cpp/compile.log by default).

o Updated to accommodate recent changes to BEGIN_RCPP/END_RCPP macros.
