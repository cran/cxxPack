What has changed since Version 5.3?

1. Support for R factors (RcppFactor)

2. Support for zoo time series (RcppZoo), and by using as.zoo, as.irts,
   as.xts, etc., support for other time series classes as well.

3. Support for R's POSIXt date type (RcppDateTime) implemented as a
   subclass of RcppDate, and consistently defined so that date differences
   are always measured in days (with financial applications in mind). There
   are a number of date utilities including Excel conversion functions.

4. RcppFrame has been rewritten so that data frames are modeled as
   a vector of columns (the previous version used an awkward vector of
   rows representation).

5. The RcppFunction class has been simplified and rewritten to support
   calling R functions with objects of any R type that we can model in C++.

6. An Rcpp namespace has been introduced to reduce namespace clutter.

7. Added more careful checking of input parameters and improved performance.
