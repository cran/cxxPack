# Set PKG_EXTRACPP and PKG_EXTRALIB below to specfiy
# any dependencies on external libraries. Use the commented
# lines as a reference. 
#
# Note that machine-dependent paths are assumed
# to be defined in environment variables. When these environment varialbes
# are defined at CRAN (currently LIB_FFTW, LIB_JPEG, etc. are defined) it
# is possible to release pacakges to CRAN that have external library
# dependences, yet the binaries for the major platforms can be built
# at CRAN (Linux, Windows, MacOS). When CRAN links to shared libs 
# (rather than static libs) the user of the binaries must of course 
# ensure that the necessary libs are installed at the OS level, and that
# search paths are setup properly.
